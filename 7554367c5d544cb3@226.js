md`There's a lot of neat stuff on the web, but as the [Introduction to Data notebook](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/introduction-to-data) mentions, you're not going to be able to load resources whose owners haven't enabled [cross-origin resources sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), or CORS, on their servers. (See the bottom of this page for a bit more on this.)üîí

This notebook provides you with a function called \`soFetch\`, which wraps around [\`fetch\`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) and sends your request to [a tiny server](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sofetch), which relays it on and gets you back your stuff. üÜí (Well, some of it. See "Limitations.")`

md`## Usage

### "Installation"
Run \`import { soFetch } from '@alecglassford/so-fetch'\` in an Observable cell.

### "API"
Then use \`soFetch(url)\`, where \`url\` is a string representing any publicly available resource that you can snag with a *really simple* GET request. In return, you'll get a promise that resolves into [a Response object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) (just like \`fetch\`).

### Limitations
As alluded to above, you can't pass through headers or a body or use any HTTP request methods besides GET. And you won't get back any headers either. ü§≠ TBH, this is because it's sufficient for my basic web-scraping needs, but I don't think it would be hard to make this a bit more robust. In fact, I may do that this weekend. But if I don't, you can give it a go by forking this notebook and [remixing the Glitch server](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/sofetch).`

md`## A bit more on CORS and the same-origin policy

More broadly, this limitation is part of the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#Security_Applications) which is totally dope, because it keeps whatever webpage you're on (e.g. this notebook), which runs code written by some potentially sketchy person (e.g. who am I?) from taking personal information in your browser (e.g. a cookie set by your bank's website) and sending it off to some target (e.g. your bank's website) and causing all sorts of trouble (e.g. $$$).

Your browser is not going to send any privileged information to  sofetch dot glitch dot me, because who the hell is that website to you anyway? So it's chill; soFetch isn't going to fetch any resource that requires any sort of authentication, and that's how it ought to be. ‚úåÔ∏è

*Note on the above paragraphs: I am no security expert, so if you want to dig more into this sort of stuff, I recommend you check out the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page).
